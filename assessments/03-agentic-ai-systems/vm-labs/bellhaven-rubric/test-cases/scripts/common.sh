# FAITHFUL REPLICA of the platform-provided /usr/local/bin/judge/test/common.sh,
# copied from a real lab VM. Used only by run-all.sh during authoring; NEVER
# shipped in TestCase.zip.
#
# It is a replica and not a convenience stub on purpose. The real helper emits
# one line of JSON and installs an ERR trap that exits the check - and a stub
# without those two behaviours let a bug through that scored a correct solution
# as "no test cases at all" on the portal. If this file is easier to pass than
# the real one, local validation is worthless.
